# Accessibility for Teams

Practices for embedding accessibility and inclusive design into a team’s workflow.

Each person on a team, whether you’re a manager, designer, or developer, has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive. Your responsibilities are different depending on your role. So that’s how we structured the guide, with a separate section for each of five roles:

- Product management
- Content design
- UX design
- Visual design
- Front-end development

**This guide provides:**

- An overview of how each team member can contribute to a product's accessibility
- A framework for thinking about accessibility and inclusive design in your role
- An understanding of the human need behind accessibility practices

We focus on the issues most likely to impact government sites. These guidelines do not provide a comprehensive list of all possible issues. Your team will need additional resources and work to conduct manual audits to conform to the standards of [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) (which aligns with the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)), a law that ensures all web content is accessible to anybody with a disability.

This guide is maintained by the Accessibility Guild in the [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA).

## Running the site

The Accessibility for Teams runs on Jekyll. To run it locally:

- Clone the repository.
- Get [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the necessary dependencies: `bundle install`
- Run the web server with `npm run start`
- Visit the local site at http://localhost:4000


### Updating USWDS to a later version.

USWDS is updated to `3` uses SASS module syntax for USWDS packages.
You can make updates to USWDS with `npm`.

#### Change theme settings

Add custom styles to `_custom-theme.scss` as described in the [uswds repo](https://github.com/uswds/uswds#sass-and-theme-settings).

This site uses custom USWDS theme settings in `_src/assets/uswds-theme`. Use this if you want to include or remove utilities or update utility settings.

1. Compile SASS `gulp compileSass`
2. Run jekyll `npm run start`
