# Accessibility for Teams

Practices for embedding accessibility and inclusive design into a team’s workflow.

Each person on a team, whether you’re a manager, designer, or developer, has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive. Your responsibilities are different depending on your role. So that’s how we structured the guide, with a separate section for each of five roles:

- Product management
- Content design
- UX design
- Visual design
- Front-end development

**This guide provides:**

- An overview of how each team member can contribute to a product's accessibility
- A framework for thinking about accessibility and inclusive design in your role
- An understanding of the human need behind accessibility practices

We focus on the issues most likely to impact government sites. These guidelines do not provide a comprehensive list of all possible issues. Your team will need additional resources and work to conduct manual audits to conform to the standards of [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) (which aligns with the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)), a law that ensures all web content is accessible to anybody with a disability.

This guide is maintained by the Accessibility Guild in the [Technology Transformation Services (TTS)](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) at the U.S. General Service Administration (GSA).
