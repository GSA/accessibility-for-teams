Install the Neat gem using the [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org) package manager:\n\n  ```bash\n  gem install neat\n  ```\n\n  Alternatively, you can install Neat with [Bower](http://bower.io).\n\n2. Install or update Neat’s dependencies:\n\n  ```bash\n  gem install sass # or gem update sass\n  ```\n\n3. Install the Neat library into the current directory:\n\n  ```bash\n  neat install\n  ```\n\n4. Import Neat in your stylesheet:\n\n  ```scss\n  @import \"neat/neat\";\n  ```\n\n  It’s not recommended to add or modify the Neat files so that you can update them easily.\n\n## Installation for Ruby on Rails\n\n1. Add Neat to your Gemfile:\n\n  ```ruby\n  gem 'neat'\n  ```\n\n2. Then run:\n\n  ```bash\n  bundle install\n  ```\n\n  If you see the error `Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem \"sass\"`, run:\n\n  ```bash\n  bundle update sass\n  ```\n\n3.  Import Neat in your `application.scss`:\n\n  ```scss\n  @import \"neat\";\n  ```\n\n  It should be noted that `@import` rules are not compatible with Sprockets directives. You need to use one or the other.\n\n## Installing with npm and using a Node-based asset pipeline\n\n1. Add Neat as a dependency:\n\n  ```bash\n  npm install --save bourbon-neat\n  ```\n\n1. If you’re using [Eyeglass](http://eyeglass.rocks), skip to Step 3. Otherwise, you’ll need to add Neat to your node-sass `includePaths` option. `require(\"bourbon-neat\").includePaths` is an array of directories that you should pass to node-sass. How you do this depends on how node-sass is integrated into your project.\n\n1. Import Neat into your Sass files:\n\n  ```scss\n  @import \"neat\";\n  ```\n\n## Installing older versions of Neat\n\n1. Uninstall any Neat gem versions you already have:\n\n  ```bash\n  gem uninstall neat\n  ```\n\n2. Reinstall the Neat gem, using the `-v` flag to specify the version you need:\n\n  ```bash\n  gem install neat -v 1.7.0\n  ```\n\n3. Follow the [instructions above](#installation) to install Neat into your project.\n\n## Using Neat\n\nFirst off, if you are planning to override the default grid settings (12 columns), it is recommended to create a `_grid-settings.scss` file for that purpose. Make sure to import it right *before* importing Neat:\n\n```scss\n@import \"grid-settings\";\n@import \"neat/neat\"; // or \"neat\" when in Rails\n```\n\nIn your newly created  `_grid-settings.scss`, import `neat-helpers` if you are planning to use `new-breakpoint()`, then define your new variables:\n\n```scss\n@import \"neat/neat-helpers\"; // or \"neat-helpers\" when in Rails\n\n// Change the grid settings\n$column: 90px;\n$gutter: 30px;\n$grid-columns: 10;\n$max-width: 1200px;\n\n// Define your breakpoints\n$tablet: new-breakpoint(max-width 768px 8);\n$mobile: new-breakpoint(max-width 480px 4);\n```\n\nSee the [docs](http://thoughtbot.github.io/neat-docs/latest/#variable) for a full list of settings.\n\nNext, include the `outer-container` mixin in the topmost container (to which the `max-width` setting will be applied):\n\n```scss\ndiv.container {\n  @include outer-container;\n}\n```\n\nThen use `span-columns` on any element to specify the number of columns it should span:\n\n```scss\ndiv.element {\n  @include span-columns(6);\n}\n```\n\nIf the element’s parent isn’t the top-most container, you need to add the number of columns of the parent element to keep the right proportions:\n\n```scss\ndiv.container {\n  @include outer-container;\n\n  div.parent-element {\n    @include span-columns(8);\n\n    div.element {\n      @include span-columns(6 of 8);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo make your layout responsive, use the `media()` mixin to modify both the grid and the layout:\n\n```scss\n.my-class {\n  @include media($mobile) { // As defined in _grid-settings.scss\n    @include span-columns(2);\n  }\n}\n\n// Compiled CSS\n@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {\n  .my-class {\n    display: block;\n    float: left;\n    margin-right: 7.42297%;\n    width: 46.28851%; // 2 columns of the total 4 in this media context\n  }\n  .my-class:last-child {\n    margin-right: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy setting `$visual-grid` to `true` in a file that is imported before\n`neat-helpers` (or prior to `neat` itself if you are using the default\nbreakpoints), you can display the base grid in the background (default) or as an\noverlay. You can even change the color and opacity of the grid-lines by\noverriding the default settings as detailed in the section below.\n\nThe visual grid reflects the changes applied to the grid via the `new-breakpoint()` mixin, as long as the media contexts are defined *before* importing Neat.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I use `omega()` in a mobile-first workflow?\n\nUsing `omega()` with an `nth-child` pseudo selector in a mobile-first workflow will cause the style to be applied to wider-viewport media queries as well. That is the cascading nature of CSS.\n\nOne solution would be to provide an `omega-reset()` mixin that negates the effect of `omega()` on that specific `nth-child` pseudo selector. While this is often the most suggested solution, it is also a lazy hack that outputs ugly code and can quickly get out of hand in complex layouts. As a general rule, having to *undo* CSS styles is a sign of poor stylesheet architecture (more about [CSS code smells](http://csswizardry.com/2012/11/code-smells-in-css/)).\n\nThe other, more elegant, solution is to use mutually exclusive media queries, also referred to as [media-query\nsplitting](http://simurai.com/blog/2012/08/29/media-query-splitting). This would guarantee that `omega()` styles are only applied where desired.\n\n```scss\n$first-breakpoint-value: 400px;\n$second-breakpoint-value: 700px;\n$medium-viewport: new-breakpoint(min-width $first-breakpoint-value max-width $second-breakpoint-value);\n$large-viewport: new-breakpoint(min-width $second-breakpoint-value + 1);\n\n.element {\n  @include media($medium-viewport) {\n    @include span-columns(6);\n    @include omega(2n);\n  }\n\n  @include media($large-viewport) {\n    @include span-columns(4);\n    @include omega(3n);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf, for some reason, you still think that `omega-reset` is the only way you want to go, check out Josh Fry’s [omega-reset](http://joshfry.me/blog/2013/05/13/omega-reset-for-bourbon-neat).\n\n#### Why are the elements not properly aligned with the visual grid?\n\nThe visual grid is built using CSS gradients whose stops might contain decimal values depending on the default settings of your grid. In order to render the gradient, browsers round the pixel values since they can’t deal with pixel fractions.\n\nAs a result the visual grid might be few pixels off in some browsers. The result is also inconsistent across browsers. For best results, preview your website on Firefox as it renders closest to the expected outcome.\n\nAt this point, writing an internal rounding mechanism is not high priority.\n\n#### Framework X has this feature that Neat seems to be missing. Can you add it?\n\nUnless you [open a pull request](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat/compare/), the answer is most likely going to be no. Neat is lightweight and simple compared to other grid frameworks, and strives to remain so. We have plans for adding new features in future versions of the framework, but these will be most likely to support new ways of working with layouts on the Web, not patches to existing ones.\n\n## Browser support\n\n- Chrome 10+\n- Firefox 29+\n- Internet Explorer 9+ (visual grid is IE 10 only)\n- Internet Explorer 8 with [selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com) (no `media()` support)\n- Opera 9.5+\n- Safari 5.1+\n\n## The Bourbon family\n\n- [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon): A simple and lightweight mixin library for Sass\n- [Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat): A lightweight semantic grid framework for Sass and Bourbon\n- [Bitters](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bitters): Scaffold styles, variables and structure for Bourbon projects\n- [Refills](https://github.com/thoughtbot/refills): Prepackaged patterns and components built with Bourbon, Neat and Bitters\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2012–2015 [thoughtbot, inc](http://thoughtbot.com).
